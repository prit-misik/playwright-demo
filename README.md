CONSIDERAIONS ON REQUIREMENTS:
1.	Navigate to https://www.gamesforthebrain.com/game/checkers/
2.	Confirm that the site is up
This requirement needs to be more precise. Since no specific verification is required, I only
verified the title of the page. But we can verify some elements on the page as well to verify the site is up.
3.	Make five legal moves as orange:
a)	Include taking a blue piece
b)	Use “Make a move” as confirmation that you can take the next step
c)	Restart the game after five moves
d)	Confirm that the restarting had been successful

Issues found on the web page:
1. "make a move" text is still visible even if orange makes a move. It should disappar untill blue
completes its move.

More verifications to be done:
1. Location of each and every piece on the board can be verified 
before making the first move.
2. After making a move, the new location of the piece can be verified.
3. After taking a blue piece, we can verify if it is disappeared.
4. We can verify the pieces can not be moved backwards unless they reached the last row of the opponent.
